# **BiCaution**
This repository contains the source code for the paper: **_Bridging Forward-Backward Interventional and Counterfactual Causal Observation for Event Graph-based Abductive Reasoning_**. In this paper, We propose a model called **_BiCaution_** which tackles Event Graph-based Abductive Reasoning especially in the scenario of **_large-scale event graph_** via “Three-Anchor, Multi-Jump” mechanism. 

## **Structure**
 - We use build_art.py and build_original_graph.py to process datasets and build our graph.
 - We define the our model in main.py.
